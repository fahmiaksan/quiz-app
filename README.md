# Quiz App

QuizBook is a web application where users can play quizzes in 6 different categories and 3 difficulty levels. This repository was created for the purpose of showcasing my projects for learning purposes and may not be used commercially.

The salient features of this application are:

- Login is provided to the user so that only that person can access the application.
- Quiz timer to make quizzes more interesting.
- Users can see the score after all questions have been answered.
- Users can contact the app developer for any queries.

The app is designed with ReactJS, NextUI, React Query, React router dom, axios, formik, yup

<b>I also highly recommend you to suggest some improvements in the project.</b>
